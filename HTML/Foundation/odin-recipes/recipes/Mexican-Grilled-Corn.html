        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ancho chile pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>8 ears corn on the cob, husked</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated cotija cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 lime, sliced</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Combine mayonnaise, lime juice, ancho chile powder, and smoked paprika in a bowl; whisk until smooth. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil corn in salted water for 5 minutes. Drain the corn.</li>
        <li>Place ears of corn on hot grill and cook until the kernels begin to brown and caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn corn and continue to cook, turning ears after 1 to 2 minutes, until they are browned with slightly charred, caramelized spots.</li>
